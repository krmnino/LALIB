# MatrixOperations
Linear Algebra mini-library of matrix operations in C++


TO-DO:
-	Change any parameters from taking a Matrix object to just take a reference to the matrix object. 
-	Implement matrix inverse fn().
-	Implement vector projection.
-	Implement matrix concatenation fn() (another constructor method may work) Potentially to be used to find inverse of a matrix 
-	Constructor method to create matrix that is m = any size and n = 1. Take src matrix as an input.
