# MatrixOperations
Linear Algebra mini-library of matrix operations in C++


TO-DO:
-	Implement matrix multiplication (not only matrix scaling)
-	Implement matrix inverse fn().
-	Implement vector projection.
-	Implement Matrix constructor fn() for idenity matrix of nxn size.
-	Implement Matrix constructor that generates matrix of mxn size with random numbers from a given range.
-	Implement matrix concatenation fn() (another constructor method may work) Potentially to be used to find inverse of a matrix 
-	Create vector class for linear algebra. (is it necessary or just use matrix and check that n = 1?)
